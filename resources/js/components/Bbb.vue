      <p>But that's only the beginning. We've had global warming for more than 10,000 years, since the end of the last Ice Age, and there is evidence temperatures were actually somewhat warmer
9,000 years ago and again 4,500 to 8,000 years ago than they are today[6].</p>
       <p> Whatever caused that,it was not human activity. It was not all those power plants and factories
           and SUVs being operated by Stone Age cavemen while chipping arrowheads out of bits of flint.
            Whatever the cause was, it melted the glaciers that in North America once extended south to Long Island and parts
          of New York City[7] into virtually complete disappearance (except for a few mountain remnants).
           That's one big greenhouse effect!</p>
          <p> If we are still having global warming - and I suppose we could presume we are,
            given this more than 10,000 year history - it seems highly likely that it is still
            the overwhelmingly primary cause of continued warming, rather than our piddling 0.0039
             contribution to the greenhouse effect.</p>
