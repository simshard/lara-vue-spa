<p>Since the start of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide is estimated to have risen from 280 ppm to the
     current approximately 400 ppm. Even if the entire increase were the result of human emissions - which is
     by no means certain, given uncertainty about how much CO2 is produced by natural sources such as decomposition
      of biomass and carbonate rock, volcanism and the little-understood ocean-atmosphere exchange - the total
       human contribution to atmospheric carbon dioxide would be about 0.3 of the total.</p>
     <p>Therefore human carbon dioxide adds at most only 0.0039 of the greenhouse effect, and may well be less.</p>
