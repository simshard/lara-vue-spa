   <p>Yet even that trend-continuation today needs to be proved. Evidence is that the Medieval Warm Period centered on the 1200s
        was somewhat warmer than we are now[8], and the climate was clearly colder in the Little Ice Age in the 1600s than it is now[9].
         (Whether the earlier Roman Warm Period around the time of Christ was as warm or was warmer than present is less clear.)

         that could be significant, or even measurable.

  <p>Principal scientists arguing for human-caused global warming have been demonstrably disingenuous[10], and now you can see why.
        They have proved they should not be trusted.</p>
    <p>The idea that we should be spending trillions of dollars and hamstringing the economy of the entire world to reduce carbon dioxide
         emissions is beyond ludicrous in light of the facts above. it is insane.</p>
