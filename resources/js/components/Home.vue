Carbon dioxide, considered the main vector for human-caused global warming, is some 0.04% of the atmosphere by volume, or some 400 parts per million (ppm)[1].</p>
 <p>Water vapor varies from 0% to 4% by volume[2], and so should easily average above 1%[3] near the Earthâ€™s surface, where the greenhouse effect would be most important,
 and is about three times more effective[4] a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.</p>
 <p>So water vapor is some 25 times more prevalent and three times more effective. that makes it some 75 times more important to the greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide[5].</p>
 <p>The TOTAL contribution of carbon dioxide to the greenhouse effect is therefore 0.013 or less.</p>
